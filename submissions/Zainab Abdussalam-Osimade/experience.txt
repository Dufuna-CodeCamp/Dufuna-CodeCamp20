My name is Zainab Abdussalam-Osimade.
The Dufuna Codecamp learning process is quite impressive

.
The dufuna app simplifies everything and the vidoe lessons are well explained.

I particularly love the fact that the female instructor does not assume you already understand a concept that has been explained before.

She teaches from scratch again so you can follow up easily.
