I am Fabunmi Tolulope Eniola. I am 50% sanguine and 50% melancholic. This means I always have the top of the hour gist and alongside can be quiet almost simultaneously. 
I detest ignorance and gullibility, it makes me want to throw up but then the teacher/educator part of me almost immediately tries to help the supposedly ignorant person. My irritability to ignorance is borne from my vast thirst and hunger for knowledge.
In all I am a great person to have around you provided you are availabe for all round clock stories ranging from biblical to mental, academics, financial- let us dissect it together.
Most importantly I am a lover of God, my husband,our son, my family and friends.
Thanks
