                     <li>Severin is the most compelling and attractive man Cassandra has ever met, 
                        even if his heart is frozen. But she has no interest in living in the fast-paced 
                        world of a ruthless man who always plays to win.</li>
                    <li>When a newfound enemy nearly destroys Cassandra’s reputation, Severin seizes the 
                        opportunity he’s been waiting for. As always, he gets what he wants—or does he? 
                        There’s one lesson Tom Severin has yet to learn from his new bride:</li>
                    <li>Never underestimate a Ravenel.</li>
                    <li>The chase for Cassandra’s hand may be over. But the chase for her heart has only just begun... </li>
