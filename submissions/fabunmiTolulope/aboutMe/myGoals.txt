I am Fabunmi Tolulope Eniola. I am so excited to be a participant of Dufuna Codecamp and I hope at the end of the 6 months: I would be a full stack developer,  I would have participated in some hackathons and successfully built an amazing online portfolio.
I have plans to have extended my network, connections and have better insights into the world of Technology. Way to go
Thanks
