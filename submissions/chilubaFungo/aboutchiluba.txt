My name is Chiluba Fungo and I have always wanted to be a developer dispite having had a bad lecturer in college. 
I have a second chance now and i will take this opportunity and become a desciplined developer as i've always wanted.
One who will know how to organise their work, follow through tasks and just be the best I can be.
All this will mean more time with my laptop which means a better relationship with it, looking forward to it everyday.
