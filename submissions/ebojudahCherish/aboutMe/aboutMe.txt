At the end of the Dufuna Codecamp I hope to be able to start and finish a project.
I hope to be able to boldly say I'm a front end developer without feeling inadequate.
I know that I still have a long way to go and one of the beauties of being a developer is that learning never stops, 
but I earnestly hope that by the end of this CodeCamp,
the constant feeling of being overwhelmed by the vastness of what I'm yet to know will be drastically reduced,
and I will be able to start and finish small projects on my own and collaborate on big ones, build web applications and provide practical solutions to real life problems with code.
I hope to have the confidence that comes with knowing what you're doing.

That's about it, oh wait!...one more thing 

More importantly, I hope to land my first developer job!
