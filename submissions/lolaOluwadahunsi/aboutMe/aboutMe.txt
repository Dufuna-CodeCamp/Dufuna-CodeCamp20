My name is Lola Oluwadahunsi. I am enjoying learning to code! Practically everything is new to me as this is uncharted territory.

At the end of this program, I hope to have gained requisite software development knowledge and skills to enable me:

- have a good understanding of software development
- take on IT projects
- have a basis for mapping out further professional development pathways

Thank you for the course so far!
