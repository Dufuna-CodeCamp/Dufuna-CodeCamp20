The world of Tech is vast and complicated but higly sort after. At the end of this code camp, my aspirations are as follows:

1. To be able to have at least three strong software engineering points in these vastness.
2. To see every complications as surmountable.
3. To be able to tranfer my gained knowledge into solving real life problems, challenges and tasks.
