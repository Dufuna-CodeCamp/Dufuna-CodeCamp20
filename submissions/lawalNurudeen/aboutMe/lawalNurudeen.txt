I'm Nurudeen Lawal. A Chemical Engineer by university education and profession. 
After watching a few youtube videos on python programming language, I immediately 
grew interest in web development in entirety, thus I registered for the 
DUFUNA CODE CAMP FULLSTACK TRACK effectively. I aim to dedicate my time into learning
fullstack web/javascript development to ease a career switch or enhance freelancing
opportunities.
